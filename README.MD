Kriging Example by Connor Johnson
=================================

I'll be recreating the "Kriging in Python" example that Connor Johnson outlines in his [blog post](http://connor-johnson.com/2014/03/20/simple-kriging-in-python/) and on his [Github](https://github.com/cjohnson318/geostatsmodels).

Readers will need Python 2.7, IPython 4.0 (plus Jupyter component), NumPy, MatPlotLib, SciPy and Pandas to run this code locally.
